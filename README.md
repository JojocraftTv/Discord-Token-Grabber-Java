# Discord-Token-Grabber-Java
A Discord Token Grabber (educational purposes only)

The new discord update now stores your token encrypted.<br>
But the key is just stored in another file.<br>
This was probably done to stop script kiddies from getting your token.<br>
<br>
This Projekt was only created to show Discord that they need to step up there security in order to prevent this!<br>
Why encrypt the Token, if you store the key in plain text, in a file?<br>

This is just for educational purposes only, if you use this code maliciously please don't... We all just want to make discord a safer place.<br>
You are responsible for your actions.
